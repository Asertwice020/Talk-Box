1. user.controller.js: {
  80: HOW DOES THIS VALIDATOR WORK FINE, WITHOUT NOT OPERATOR(!)

  97: IF USER PROVIDES AVATAR BUT, CLOUDINARY FALIED TO UPLOAD AVATAR. SO WE SHOULD STOP THE PROCESS AT THAT MOMENT OTHERWISE IN THE DB: AVATAR FIELD WILL EMPTY. (TEST CASE)  

  106: WHY DID NOT YOU USE "secure_url" -> // avatar: avatar?.secure_url, -> it's also work same but i don't know the difference yet!

  188: I UNABLE TO CATCH WHY WE ARE GIVING ALL THE DATA TO "USER". WHAT IS THIS USER ANYWAY (UNABLE TO THINK/VIRTUALIZE)

  211: REVIEW THE LOGOUT CONTROLLER CAREFULLY, MAYBE THERE IS A LOOPHOLE. IF THIS CONTROLLER ONLY REMOVES REFRESH TOKEN FIELD FROM THAT PARTICULAR USER DOCUMENT.
  S0 ->
  [{
    REGISTER-STATE: THERE IS NO REFRESH TOKEN VALUE IN THAT FILED. IT MUST BE EMPTY.

    LOGGED-IN-STATE: REFRESH TOKEN FIELD NOW HAVE A VALUE.

    LOGOUT-STATE: THAT PARTICULAR USER DOCUMENT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REFRESH TOKEN FIELD NOW.
  },
  {
    NOTE: I DON'T TOUCH THE CODE YET. FIRST TEST THIS OUT. AND VALIDATE YOUR THEORY.
  }]

  287: REVIEW THE GENERATE-NEW-ACCESS-TOKEN ENDPOINT CONTROLLER CAREFULLY.
